== Introduction

ConTAct is an application for teaching assistants who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing students*. More importantly, ConTAct is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ConTAct can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `conTAct.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ConTAct.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe sn/A98765432 e/johnd@example.com f/School of Computing` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME sn/STUDENT_NUMBER`, `sn/STUDENT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

Examples:
```
tag add 1 t/tut1 // Adds the tag "tut1" to first person in list
tag set 1 t/tut1 // Removes all tags from first person in list and adds tag "tut1"
tag del 1 t/tut1 // Removes the tag "tut1" to first person in list (does not do anything if supplied tag is not found)

tag add m/students t/cs2103 // Adds the tag "cs2103" to all students in the mark named "students"
```

Note:

* The command accepts any number of tags (including 0), using `tag set` with no tags supplied will clear all tags
* The command will not fail even if the supplied tag is already present in the case of `tag add` and `tag set`
* The command will not fail even if the supplied tag is absent in the case of `tag delete`
* The command will still display a success message if the above cases occur

// tag::mark[]
=== Mark: `mark`
A Mark represents a group of Students in the app. Some commands accept Marks as an alternative to INDEX as a parameter to quickly perform batch operations.

==== Mark Creation
Format: `mark find t/TAGNAME` or `mark find KEYWORD`

This creates a Mark containing the Students returned by the find command with the supplied arguments.

E.g. `mark find t/friends` will find all students in the Address Book tagged with "friends" and add them to a Mark.

==== Named Marks
Marks can be named by using the prefix `m/MARKNAME`. If not specified, the name of the created Mark will default to "m/default".

E.g. `mark m/myMarkName t/friends` will add the Students tagged with "friends" to a Mark called "myMarkName"

Note: Mark names must be alphanumeric and do not contain spaces.

==== Manipulating Marks
Marks are able to be manipulated in the same way as sets, namely, they support the following operations: `union (join)`, `intersection (and)`, `complement (NYI)`

Format: `mark [m/DEST_MARK] <operation> m/OPERANDMARK1 [m/OPERANDMARK2]`

E.g. `mark m/students join m/tut1 m/tut2` m/students will contain the Students of m/tut1 and m/tut2 merged together

E.g. `mark m/canRetake and m/absentFromTest m/validReason` -- m/canRetake will contain Students that are in both m/absentFromTest and m/validReason

Note: The first operand is compulsory while the second operand is optional and will default to "m/default"

==== Displaying Marks
The Students in a Mark can be shown in the GUI wit the following command:

`mark [m/MARKTOBESHOWN] show`

==== Reference
`mark [m/m1] ...`

* `find <KEYWORD|t/TAG...>` -- finds persons matching KEYWORD in their name or matching specified tags and mark under _m1_
* `join m/m2 m/m3` -- sets _m1_ to be the *union* of _m2_ and _m3_
* `and m/m2 m/m3` -- sets _m1_ to be the *intersection* of _m2_ and _m3_
* `show` -- displays students from _m1_ in the GUI

Notes:

* _m1_ defaults to "default" if omitted

Examples:

* `mark find t/friends` -- adds all students with tag _t/friends_ under _m/default_
* `mark m/abc find t/colleagues` -- marks all students with tag _t/colleagues_ under _m/abc_
* `mark join m/a m/b` -- marks students in either _m/a_ or _m/b_ under _m/default_ (union of a and b)
* `mark and m/a m/b` -- marks students in both _m/a_ and _m/b_ under _m/default_ (intersection of a and b)
* `mark m/test show` -- shows students marked under _m/test_ in the GUI

=== Saving the data

Address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== Introduction

ConTAct is an application for teaching assistants who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing students*. More importantly, ConTAct is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ConTAct can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `conTAct.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ConTAct.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe sn/A98765432 e/johnd@example.com f/School of Computing` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME sn/STUDENT_NUMBER`, `sn/STUDENT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

Allows the user to mark the attendance of students using the index number as well as group name. +
Format: `attendance INDEX_NUMBER at/ATTENDANCE` or `attendance g/GROUP_NAME at/ATTENDANCE`

* The attendance marking as present is done individually, by using the index number of the student. The user can also collectively mark the attendance using the GROUP feature. Then, the user can update the attendance of the students who do not follow the majority specifically. The user can update the attendance of the student/students who are absent as 'absent'/'0' and who are present as 'present'/'1'(any other value updates the attendance to undefined).

//end::email[]

// tag::group[]
=== Group: `group`
A Group represents a group of Students in the app. Some commands accept Groups as an alternative to INDEX as a parameter to quickly perform batch operations.

==== Group Creation
Format: `group find t/TAGNAME` or `group find KEYWORD`

This creates a Group containing the Students returned by the find command with the supplied arguments.

E.g. `group find t/friends` will find all students in the Address Book tagged with "friends" and add them to a Group.

==== Named Groups
Groups can be named by using the prefix `g/GROUPNAME`. If not specified, the name of the created Group will default to "g/default".

E.g. `group g/myGroupName find t/friends` will add the Students tagged with "friends" to a Group called "myGroupName"

Note: Group names must be alphanumeric and do not contain spaces.

==== Manipulating Groups
Groups are able to be manipulated in the same way as sets, namely, they support the following operations: `union (join)`, `intersection (and)`, `complement (NYI)`

Format: `group [g/DEST_GROUP] <operation> g/OPERANDGROUP1 [g/OPERANDGROUP2]`

E.g. `group g/students join g/tut1 g/tut2` g/students will contain the Students of g/tut1 and g/tut2 merged together

E.g. `group g/canRetake and g/absentFromTest g/validReason` -- g/canRetake will contain Students that are in both g/absentFromTest and g/validReason

Note: The first operand is compulsory while the second operand is optional and will default to "g/default"

==== Displaying Groups
The Students in a Group can be shown in the GUI with the following command:

`group [g/GROUPTOBESHOWN] show`

==== Interactions with `undo` and `redo`
Due to the way `undo` and `redo` are implemented, Groups that are changed as a result of these commands will not behave as expected, the students that are changed will be removed from the Group.

==== Reference
`group [g/m1] ...`

* `find <KEYWORD|t/TAG...>` -- finds persons matching KEYWORD in their name or matching specified tags and group under _m1_
* `join g/m2 g/m3` -- sets _m1_ to be the *union* of _m2_ and _m3_
* `and g/m2 g/m3` -- sets _m1_ to be the *intersection* of _m2_ and _m3_
* `show` -- displays students from _m1_ in the GUI

Notes:

* _m1_ defaults to "default" if omitted

Examples:

* `group find t/friends` -- adds all students with tag _t/friends_ under _g/default_
* `group g/abc find t/colleagues` -- groups all students with tag _t/colleagues_ under _g/abc_
* `group join g/a g/b` -- groups students in either _g/a_ or _g/b_ under _g/default_ (union of a and b)
* `group and g/a g/b` -- groups students in both _g/a_ and _g/b_ under _g/default_ (intersection of a and b)
* `group g/test show` -- shows students grouped under _g/test_ in the GUI
// end::group[]

=== Deleting a student : `delete`

Deletes the specified student from the address book. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd student in the address book.
* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st student in the results of the `find` command.

=== Selecting a student : `select`

Selects the student identified by the index number used in the displayed student list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* Selects the student and loads the Google search page the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd student in the address book.
* `find Betsy` +
`select 1` +
Selects the 1st student in the results of the `find` command.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the address book and/or calendar to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`) or the calendar's content (`schedule`, `cancel`, and `clear`)
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`schedule event/CS2103 Consultation date/24-9-2019 start/18:00 end/19:00` +
`undo` (reverses the `schedule event/CS2103 Consultation date/24-9-2019 start/18:00 end/19:00` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::clear[]
=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book and calendar. +
Format: `clear`
// end::clear[]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Tag Students: `tag`
Adds, sets or deletes tags from students (by index or by name).

Format: `tag add|set|del index|g/group [t/tags...]`

Examples:
```
tag add 1 t/tut1 // Adds the tag "tut1" to first person in list
tag set 1 t/tut1 // Removes all tags from first person in list and adds tag "tut1"
tag del 1 t/tut1 // Removes the tag "tut1" to first person in list (does not do anything if supplied tag is not found)

tag add g/students t/cs2103 // Adds the tag "cs2103" to all students in the group named "students"
```

Note:

* The command accepts any number of tags (including 0), using `tag set` with no tags supplied will clear all tags
* The command will not fail even if the supplied tag is already present in the case of `tag add` and `tag set`
* The command will not fail even if the supplied tag is absent in the case of `tag delete`
* The command will still display a success message if the above cases occur

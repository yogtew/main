== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `EventListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores the Calendar data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the Calendar data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::email[]
=== Email feature
==== Current implementation - Emailing a single student

The email feature is faciliated by Outlook Mail API, since most NUS teaching assistants have an Outlook account. This API is a RESTful API, made for server-client communication. Since the Outlook mail API is a RESTful API, this feature uses the 'POST' request (which requests that the web server accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message) to send the email specified in the user-input to the student specified in the user-input.
The email command itself takes a few parameters:

* `Index`: Index number of student in list. Only positive numbers present in list are valid.(`i/`)
* `Subject`: Subject of email to be sent, valid if not an empty string.(`s/`)
* `Body`: Subject of email to be sent, valid if not an empty string.(`b/`)

e.g `email i/2 s/Attendance poor. b/Your attendance seems to be poor. Is there a problem?`

When the user inputs the email in the CLI, the app fetches the email address of the student `index` specified and the subject and body of the email specified. This is converted to JSON, and passed as the `body` of the 'POST' request to Outlook.

The `CommandResult` object that is returned by the email command lets the user know if the email address has been successfully send to the student whose index is specified.

.Component interactions for email command
image::EmailCommand Sequence Diagram.png[width="800"]

In the 'POST' request, a access token is required in order to be able to communicate to the web server, which is `Outlook` in this case. To get this access token from Outlook, a authorization code must be used, which is also provided when applicatoin is registered and authorized under Outlook. Only with this access token, can the email that is created be sent to Outlook as a 'POST' request.

.App interactions with Outlook for email command
image::UML REST API.png[width="400"]

==== Alternative implementations:

Including UI features to make Outlook's mail drafting screen appear in the `Browser Panel`, and requiring the user to input the index of student to email, the subject, and the body as three seperate inputs instead of one.

//tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar feature
==== Current Implementation

Th event feature is largely centered around the `Event` class, and is integrated into ConTAct in a similar fashion to the address book.
The main commands supporting this feature are `schedule` and `cancel`, which both interact with the `Calendar` model by adding and deleting events from the calendar respectively.
The `undo/redo` and `clear` commands were also modified to extend towards the calendar model.

The Event class has these fields that the user can specify to schedule an event:

* Event Name: The name of the event, valid if it is not an empty string.
* Date: The date of the event, valid if expressed in this form:  `DD-MM-YYYY`.
It must also be a date that actually falls within a calendar and between the years 1600 to 9999 (i.e. dates such as 25-13-2000 are invalid).
* Start Time: The start time of the event, valid in this form: `HH:MM`, in 24-hour format.
* End Time: The end time of the event, valid if it is in this form: `HH:MM`, in 24-hour format.
The end time must also come after the start time.
* Description: (OPTIONAL) The description of the event, valid if it is not an empty string.

Events are compared to each other chronologically, first by their dates, then their start times, then end times, and finally alphabetically by their event names. Events are considered equal if these fields are the same, ignoring description.

During runtime, the events are stored in an observable list in the model architecture.
This list is exposed to the UI to display the list accordingly.
Furthermore, the event data is permanently stored in a `calendar.xml` file for use between sessions.

Below are several commands that allow the user to interact with the events:

===== Schedule

The `schedule` command allows the user to add a unique event to the calendar, and it is implemented as such:

* `schedule event/EVENT_NAME date/DATE start/START_TIME end/END_TIME [descr/DESCRIPTION]`

Below is an example of how the schedule command behaves:

`schedule event/CS2103 Tutorial 1 date/23-01-2018 start/15:00 end/16:00 descr/Introduction to Software Engineering`

This will simply create an event with the specified fields and store it accordingly.

Once scheduled, the events will be inserted in its sorted position (by chronological order).

The GUI itself will have a calendar component which will display the user's current list of events that they have
scheduled. On startup, the calendar will scroll to the first upcoming event.

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `schedule EVENT`, where `EVENT` is the event as specified by the input parameters.

.Component interactions for `schedule EVENT` command (part 1)
image::ScheduleEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The diagram below shows how the EventsCenter reacts to the CalendarChangedEvent, which also results in updates to the storage and the UI.

.Component interactions for `schedule EVENT` command (part 2)
image::EventStorageSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The diagram below shows how the schedule command is parsed in the Logic component. Here again, `EVENT` is the event as specified by the input parameters.

.Logic diagram for `schedule EVENT` command
image::ScheduleEventSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

===== Cancel

The `cancel` command is essentially the reverse of the schedule command, allowing the user to delete events from the calendar. It is implemented as such:

* `cancel event/EVENT_NAME date/DATE start/START_TIME end/END_TIME`

An example usage would be

`cancel event/CS2103 Tutorial 1 date/23-01-2018 start/15:00 end/16:00`

From there, the event with the specified fields will be located in the event list, and deleted accordingly.

If the event is not present within the calendar, the user will receive an error message.

Also, the interactions between the components work in much the same way as the schedule command.

===== Undo/Redo

The `undo` and `redo` command was extended to include the actions made by the user while interacting with the calendar.

The undo/redo feature is also facilitated by a VersionedCalendar, and further details are as described in the undo/redo section.

The most pertinent aspect of this feature is how the model component handles the undo/redo. The ModelManager simply keeps track of _which_
model -- address book or calendar -- had committed a change, and handles it accordingly whenever the user wishes to undo or redo.

As such, the ModelManager only exposes two main methods for handling the `undo` and `redo` command, which are `undo()` and `redo()` respectively. From there, the ModelManager handles the undo/redo operation for the respective model.

The way this is done is simply by maintaining an enum `ModelType` which denotes which model the action had been performed on. Two stacks are also maintained: `undoStack` and `redoStack`, that keeps track of the corresponding operations performed. When a specific model is committed, it is pushed to the `undoStack` and the `redoStack` is cleared, and when the `undo` command is executed, it simply pops from the `undoStack` and pushes the result to the `redoStack`.

As such, the user will be able to perform the following actions to yield the subsequent results:

1. `schedule event/CS2103 Tutorial 1 date/23-01-2018 start/15:00 end/16:00 descr/Introduction to Software Engineering`
will add the specified event to the calendar,
2. `add n/Damith Rajapakse sn/A98765432 e/damith@nus.edu.sg f/School of Computing`
will add the following person to the address book,
3. `undo`
will undo step 2 performed on the address book,
4. `undo`
will undo step 1 performed on the calendar,
5. `redo`
will redo the changes made at step 4, which in turn redoes step 1.

===== Clear

Previously, the clear command only cleared the address book. Now, it clears both the address book and the calendar, and
interacts as expected with the undo/redo command as well.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storing the sorted list of events
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the list of events in a sorted list, with adding, removing, and finding all done through binary search.
** Pros: Consistent with the overall design of the model, and also significantly reduces the overhead in performing the above operations.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the list of events in a binary search tree.
** Pros: More efficient addition and removal of events.
** Cons: Is unfeasible with the current design due to constraints with how JavaFX interacts with the data.

==== Aspect: Displaying the events in the GUI
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display it as a sorted list of events.
** Pros: Can be thought of as a to-do list, much more detailed representation.
** Cons: Not as intuitive and easily understood.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Display it within a calendar.
** Pros: Much easier to glance through and understand.
** Cons: Significantly harder to implement, and current java libraries are not feasible to utilize.

==== Aspect: How to display events
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Simply display all events, and scroll to nearest upcoming event.
** Pros: Allows the user to see the entire list of events, past and future.
** Cons: Will definitely get cluttered over time.

* **Alternative 2:** Display upcoming events, and keep past events in a "history" tab.
** Pros: Is a compromise between the alternative 1 and 3.
** Cons: May make the GUI itself cluttered.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete events once they are in the past.
** Pros: Keeps things neat and in a to-do fashion.
** Cons: Takes control away from the user to handle their own events.

===== Aspect: How schedule handles the event model and storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the list of events within the same model as the addressbook, but keep
storage separate.
** Pros: Will be consistent with the implementation of the addressbook, while also ensuring that the storage component
is distinct.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the list of events as its own separate model and separate storage.
** Pros: Will not interfere greatly with the implementation of the addressbook itself
** Cons: Will be detached from the original architecture
// end::calendar[]

// tag::attendance[]
=== Attendance feature
==== Current Implementation

The attendance command is a completely new feature that allows the user to mark the attendance of students
within ConTAct. It follows a similar command flow as that of the address book, and the command will uses the model and
storage of the other commands. 
To facilitate this command, a new data type is introduced: the Attendance class.
The Attendance class has it's own unique fields that the user can specify to mark the attendance. The Attendance class
uses another class called the AttendanceEnum class. 
This AttendanceEnum class is used to declare the Attendance Enums:PRESENT, ABSENT and UNDEFINED which are then used in the Attendance class. 
The attendance class has an overloaded constructor which takes in different parameters.

Field of first constructor:

* Attendance: takes in an AttendanceEnum, can be PRESENT, ABSENT or UNDEFINED

Field of second constructor:

* Attendance: takes in a String attendance, where absent/0 is changed to ABSENT enum, present/1 to PRESENT enum and an empty string is changed to UNDEFINED enum

Currently, the main operation is the `attendance` command, and it is implemented as such:

* `attendance index/INDEX PREFIX_ATTENDANCE/attendance`

The `attendance` command may also be used with the `mark` command to update the attendance of multiple students at the same time. It is implemented as such: 

* `attendance PREFIX_MARK/markName PREFIX_ATTENDANCE/attendance`

Currently, this operation exists within the logic component of ConTAct.

Below is an example of how the attendance command behaves:

`attendance 1 at/0`
`attendance m/tutorial1 at/1`

This will simply specify the attendance field of the Student/Students with the specified attendance and store it similar to how the addressbook stores a student.
Furthermore, the attendance command ensures that all the fields specified must be valid for it to be a success.

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the attendance command.

.Component interactions for `attendance` command (part1)

The diagram below shows how the EventsCenter reacts to the AddressBookChangedEvent, which also results in updates to the storage and the UI.

The diagram below shows how the `attendance` command is parsed in the Logic component.

.Logic Diagram for `attendance` command
image::attendance_diagram_logic.png[width="800"]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::markfeature[]
=== Mark feature
Marks allow tutors to manage groups of students easily without typing a command multiple times for each student in the class.
It is designed to work well with the existing `Tag` system, and designed with commands such as `attendance` and `email` in mind.
It is session based, meaning that groups are not stored in the data files after the app has closed, and is not intended as a replacement for `Tag`.

==== Implementation
`Mark` is a container class which stores a `Set<Student>` and exposes getter and setter methods, as well as methods for union and intersection of `Marks`.

Marks are maintained by `ModelManager`, which is responsible for updating, storing and providing the correct `Mark` for commands.

Commands relating to the creation and manipulations of Marks are parsed by `MarkCommandParser`, which then returns the appropriate `MarkSubCommand` to be executed.
It is designed in this way to be easily extensible in the future as more sub-commands are added.

The commands adhere to the following pattern:

 mark [m/m1] <subcommand> [m/m2] [m/m3]`

The arguments `m/m1`, `m/m2`, `m/m3` may be optional in some cases and default to `Mark.DEFAULT_NAME`

==== Sub-commands
* `find [name|tag]` -- marks Students matched by find command
* `join m/m2 [m/m3]` -- returns union of m2 and m3
* `and m/m2 [m/m3]` -- returns intersection of m2 and m3
* `show` -- shows marked Students in GUI

==== Planned Sub-commands (1.4)
* `tag [tagName]` -- tags marked Students with tagName
* `attd [0|1]` -- marks attendance of marked Students
* `email [emailText]` -- sends email to marked Students

==== Use Cases:
Suppose a tutor wants to mark the attendance of all students from tutorial groups W13 and W14.

Instead of:

 find t/W13
 attendance 1 at/Present
 attendance 2 at/Present
 attendance 3 at/Present
 ...
 find t/W14
 attendance 1 at/Present
 attendance 2 at/Present
 attendance 3 at/Present
 ...

The tutor can type in:

 mark m/a find t/W13` // adds students tagged with "W13" to mark m/a
 mark m/b find t/W14` // adds students tagged with "W14" to mark m/b
 mark m/res join m/a m/b` // merges students in m/a and m/b to mark m/res
 attendance m/res at/Present` // updates the marked students' attendance

Suppose the tutor then wants to send an email to the aforementioned group of students.
They can do that with a simple command:

 email m/res b/[emailText]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_


|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== PROJECT: ConTAct

---

== Overview

ConTAct is a desktop application designed to aid teaching assistants by providing them with features that is
catered specifically for their use while still managing to be all-purpose enough to serve a variety of needs.

Tutors interact with the application through the CLI, and the GUI is implemented using JavaFX. The app itself is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* Code Contributed: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=andrewtanjs&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-07&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense Report]

* *Major enhancement*: added the Calendar feature in ConTAct
** What it does: Allows the tutor to manage their calendar and timetables through the use of various commands
** Justification: This feature significantly improves the product by offering a means for the tutor to keep track of their day to day schedule and manage it accordingly.
** Highlights: This feature adds the `schedule` and `cancel` command as ways for the user to interact with the calendar, while integrating existing commands such as `undo/redo` and `clear` to support the calendar.
The design considerations were significant to ensure that the calendar was implemented effectively.
** Credits: The initial addressbook-level4 provided a good starting platform for the implementation of this feature.
